<h1>5.1 Analysis of Teacher Platform Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-of-teacher-platform-implementation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This section gives a detailed view of teachers’ engagement and implementation of instructional activities in <a class="reference external" href="http://code.org">code.org</a>. Through this analysis, we aimed to segment teachers based on their levels of platform implementation, which was gauged through metrics like the number of unique scripts they assigned and the number of students they taught. The resulted cluster membership could denote how actively teachers are involved with the platform, both in terms of the variety (unique scripts) and reach (unique students).</p>

<p>Teachers were segmented into three distinct clusters:</p>
<p><strong>Low Implementation</strong>: Teachers who, up to a certain year, had assigned fewer unique scripts and engaged with fewer unique students cumulatively.</p>
<p><strong>Medium Implementation</strong>: Teachers who had a moderate cumulative count of unique script assignments and student engagements up to that year.</p>
<p><strong>High Implementation</strong>: The most active teachers who, cumulatively, assigned a large number of unique scripts and reached many unique students up to that year.</p>

<p>At the top of each plot, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis H-test are displayed. This test is a non-parametric method used to determine if there are statistically significant differences between two or more groups. The p-value gives the probability that the differences observed could have occurred by random chance. The η2 value is the effect size, which quantifies the magnitude of the observed effect.</p>

<li><p>The <strong>High Implementation cluster</strong>, cumulatively, not only assigns more unique scripts but also reaches a broader unique student audience up to that year.
