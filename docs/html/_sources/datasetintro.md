# 2. Overview of Datasets

The datasets analyzed in this study were obtained from code.org and teachers in Milwaukee. There are two primary sources of data:

Daily Activity Data: This dataset documents student usage patterns on the code.org platform, including teacher_id, student_id, course and script information, time spent, and types of activities completed. The data provides insight into student engagement levels.

Assessment Data: This dataset contains information on student performance on coding assessments administered through code.org. Details include number of attempts, and best assessment results . This data enables analysis of academic outcomes.

Together, these datasets from code.org and Milwaukee teachers support investigation of the relationships between student behaviors on the code.org platform and their assessment results. The activity data offers predictors while the assessment data provides the outcomes to be modeled.
