## Abstract
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of user engagement data from the Code.org platform, with a focus on both student and teacher interactions. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends that offer valuable insights into how users engage with Code.org. These findings aim to assist stakeholders like educators and platform developers in making data-driven decisions to improve engagement and learning outcomes.

Through narrative, visualizations, and code, this report explores the dataset to identify key trends and derive meaningful implications. The subsequent sections provide an in-depth yet accessible analysis, starting with exploratory overviews and building to more advanced statistical interpretations.
